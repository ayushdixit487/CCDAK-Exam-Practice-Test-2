A consumer sends a request to commit offset 2000. There is a temporary communication problem, 
so the broker never gets the request and therefore never responds. Meanwhile, 
the consumer processed another batch and successfully committed offset 3000. What should you do?

1. Nothing 
2. Add a new consumer
3.  Restart the consumer.
